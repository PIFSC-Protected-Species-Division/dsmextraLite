Description: User-friendly tools for the detection and assessment of 
  extrapolation in multivariate environmental space (Bouchet et al. 2019), with 
  applications to density surface models of line transect data. Provides 
  convenience functions for summarising and visualising extrapolation in 
  prediction areas. This is a streamlined version of the dsmextras package 
  (https://github.com/densitymodelling/dsmextra) that uses update spatial data 
  packages
